Fortune Sweep Algorithm to generate Voronoi Diagram

The project aims at implementing Fortune Sweep algorithm. The Output of the project is an applet. The folder includes
code as well as executable java classes.

How to use the applet.
-----------------------

The applet has just two buttons. Points can be generated by clicking on the applet window and the button "Generate Voronoi"
generates the Voronoi diagram. Clear Button exits the applet.

I have only been able to implement the algorithm partially. There are bugs in the code which I have not been able to debug.
The most major difficulty I faced is determining the break point dynamically and determining which of the two intersection
points of the parabolas is the current breakpoint. This has caused several problems which I have been trying to debug. 

Currently the code can generate Voronoi Diagram only for 3 or less points. For greater number of points the code fails.
