Fortune Sweep Algorithm to generate Voronoi Diagram

The project aims at implementing Fortune Sweep algorithm. The Output of the project is an applet. The folder includes
code as well as executable java classes.

How to use the applet.
-----------------------

The applet has just two buttons. Points can be generated by clicking on the applet window and the button "Generate Voronoi" generates the Voronoi diagram. Clear Button exits the applet.

Status.
-------

The code can generate voronoi diagram for arbitrary number of points unless the points are too close in which case the exact floating point computations are required which have not been implemented in this code.
